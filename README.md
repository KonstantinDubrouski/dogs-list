## 🤖 AI-generated Deliverables

The following artefacts were drafted with the help of generative AI:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Concept** | Initial idea of an educational Flutter app that lists dog breeds and shows images, focusing on clean architecture and offline UX. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | • The breed list must remain visible when offline.<br>• Pull-to-refresh shows an English SnackBar on failure.<br>• Breed images grid shows a centered error text when offline.<br>• Navigation: Breed List → Images Grid → Full-screen viewer.<br>• Architecture follows Clean Architecture layers (data/domain/presentation). |
| **Architecture & Navigation Doc** | Explains that navigation is built with Navigator 2.0 (MaterialPageRoute stack), state managed via flutter_bloc (BLoC pattern), and the codebase follows Clean Architecture: feature-first folders split into data / domain / presentation with Repository pattern and use-cases. |
